A user’s location may be used to suggest other users with whom they might want to connect, analyze usage trends, or target certain promotions.</div><div><br></div><div><b>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cookies and Automated Information Collection</b></div><div>When you access our Services, we collect certain technical information in order to: (a) analyze the usage of our Services; (b) provide a more personalized experience; and (c) manage advertising.

We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your device. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third-parties.</div><div><br></div><div>”Web Beacons”&nbsp;&nbsp;(also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to know if a certain page was visited or whether an email was opened, to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages, to identifying the source of a new installation, to delivering ads to you on other websites. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the device, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an email).</div><div> </div><div>“Flash Cookies” are local shared objects, which help us to prevent fraud, remember your in-Game preferences and speed up load times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div> </div><div>Please note that companies delivering advertisements in the Games or on our Site may also use cookies or other technologies, and those practices are subject to their own policies.</div><div> </div><div><b>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Sources</b></div><div>We may collect or receive information from other sources including: (a) other thatgamecompany users who choose to upload their email contacts, and (b) third-party information providers.

We may supplement this process by placing notices in the Games and on the Site. You should periodically check thatgamecompany.com&nbsp;and this privacy page for updates. Continued use of the Services after changes are made to the Privacy Policy would be considered acceptance of the terms, and that if you do not agree with the terms or changes you should refrain from using the Services.</div><div><br></div><div><b>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharing Your Information for Direct Marketing Purposes</b></div><div>We do not share personal information with third-parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure, typically by “opting-in” to receive information from a third-party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion through our Services. If you do ask us to share your personal information with a third-party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third-party (other than our service providers) on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third-party, do not opt-in to such use when you provide personal information through our Services.</div><div><br></div><div><b>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Links to Other Sites</b></div><div>Our Services may contain links to websites and services that are owned or operated by third-parties (each, a “Third-Party Service”).

While some newer browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features which, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked, a DNT protocol that can be implemented across multiple devices and sites has not yet been widely adopted. Currently, our computer system does not support, and cannot act on DNT signal headers that we may receive; accordingly, the choices that we provide you concerning out collection and use of personally identifiable information will continue to operate as described in this policy.</div><div><br></div><div><b>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International Transfer</b></div><div>Your personal information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you’re located outside the United States and choose to provide your personal information to us, we may transfer your personal information to the United States and process it there.</div><div><br></div><div><b>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contact Us</b></div><div>If you have any questions, comments or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy and/or practices, please contact us by any of the following methods:</div><ul><li><div>Customer Support (HelpShift) - thatgamecompany.helpshift.com</div></li><li><div>Legal Inquiries - legal@thatgamecompany.com</div></li><li><div>General Inquiries - discord.gg/thatskygame</div></li><li><div>Mailing Address - 1450 2nd St, #315, Santa Monica CA 90401</div></li><li><div>Twitter - @thatgamecompany</div></li></ul></div>
